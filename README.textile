My first foray into functional programming with fsharp - a DLL for checking a
string to see if it's a valid EAN. Also includes a very small command line app
that uses the DLL to check if an argument is an EAN.

h2. Dependencies

I'm a ruby guy that uses linux, so I'm using Rake as my build tool and mono for
compilation.

On Debian, run the following as root to get the necesary packages:

    @aptitude install rake mono-2.0-devel mono-gmcs mono-mcs mono-runtime mono-utils nunit

This also requires the fsharp compiler to be installed and available at a hard
coded location. I'll fix this at some point. To get fsharp installed with mono,
follow the instructions at
http://www.strangelights.com/fsharp/Wiki/default.aspx/FSharpWiki.MonoLinux

h2. Compiling

To compile the EAN13 assembly, run:

    @rake compile

To compile the test app, run:

    @rake compile_app

To run the test suite, use:

    @rake

h3. Running

To run the app, use:

    @ean13app.exe 9780330423625
