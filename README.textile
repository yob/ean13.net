My first foray into functional programming a fsharp. A test app that checks a string
to see if it's a valid EAN13 code.

h2. Dependencies

Requires the fsharp compiler to be installed and available at a hard coded
location. I'll fix this at some point. To get fsharp installed with mono,
follow the instructions at http://www.strangelights.com/fsharp/Wiki/default.aspx/FSharpWiki.MonoLinux

h2. Compiling

To compile the app, run:

    @rake

h3. Running

To run the app, use:

    @ean13.exe 9780330423625
